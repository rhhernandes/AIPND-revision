1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
 No. Resnet and Alexnet correctly classified it as a Lhasa Apso. VGG classified it as a shih-tzu.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
Yes.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.
 Yes.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.
For this particular case of uploaded images, Alexnet or Resnet took less time to run and correctly classified the dog breed as lhasa apso. In general, though, considering the larger dataset provided, VGG seems more accurate, while taking more time to run.
