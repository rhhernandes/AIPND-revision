1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
 No. Resnet and Alexnet correctly classified it as a Lhasa Apso. VGG classified it as a shih-tzu.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
Yes.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.
 Yes.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.
VGG, if I'll be running a limited number of matches. It was the one which took longest to run, but the only one which correctly classified the dogs as being dogs --both Resnet and Alexnet correctly identified the breed, but did not classify the dogs as being dogs. VGG classified the dog images as shih-tzu, which is extremely similar to the actual breed lhasa apso. With some more training, perhaps it could improve its classification.
